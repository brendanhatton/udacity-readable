This is the project required as part of the Redux module of the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019/)

The requirements are basically to rebuild reddit, with an emphasis on using Redux to manage the state of the application.

To launch to application, simply run `npm install` and then `npm start`
The launch the backend server, you will need to use this [starter project](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter)

Styling is not my thing. Totally totally not. I would love to spend more time refining this, adding additional features and improving / playing with the code. And maybe I will. But at the moment I have spent much more time than I expected completing this project, and have other things that I need to work on, so am submitting as is. I believe the present functionally fulfills all the requirements, but has nothing extra, and looks amazingly ugly :)

Enjoy!
